# DeckEmulator
## Instructions
When the program runs, first it shows on the terminal a **greetings message**. Then, it tells that the **game** is **loading**. This is because the `InitDeck` function is called in order to initialize the deck with five random cards. It could take some **minutes to initialize** the game, so **be patient**. It depends on the **random** **cards** that are being generated and that those cards **don't repeat**.
