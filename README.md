# DeckEmulator
## Instructions
When the program runs, first it shows on the terminal a **greetings message**. Then, it tells that the **game** is **loading**. This is because the `InitDeck` function is called in order to initialize the deck with five random cards. It could take some **minutes to initialize** the game, so **be patient**. It depends on the **random** **cards** that are being generated and that those cards **don't repeat**.

When the cards are generated it shows an **options menu** where it lists all the available options that the games has, followed by the **random deck** that was generated, the **player's hand**, and the **choice input**. Depending on the player's input it sends them to a `different function`, the functions have a segment where, if the player tries something that they shouldn't, it pops a message saying why they canÂ´t choice that.

The player can choose one of the next **actions**:
1. `p` -> pull
